<h2>To replicate this exercise:</h2>

1. Start by running your Metasploitable 2 VM and retrieving the IP Address of your Meta 2.

2. Once Metasploitable 2 is running, ensure that the IP in the variable 'target' matches your Metasploitable 2 IP.

3. Save and run the program with the following command: <br><code>python3 subdir_search.py</code>

4. The program will proceed to test and print out all the subdirectories in the mutillidae website found on the dirs.txt file.


<h2>Notes:</h2>

1. Ensure that dirs.txt is in the same folder.

2. dirs.txt is not a comprehensive text file of all possible subdirectories.
